## Ideas

- Inspired by Crypto symbols that is not traded with stable coin etc `BNBBTC`, `ETHBTC`
- Use investpy-api to get OHLC data of SET index and stocks in Thailand
- Create as an interactable webapp using Streamlit
- Add some customizations!

## Run app locally

`docker build -t streamlitapp:latest .`
`docker run streamlitapp`

## Deployment

Comming soon! (Hopefully)
